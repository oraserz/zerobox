## CLI usage

OronBox provides a powerful, scriptable command-line interface for managing devices, installing resources, accessing community sources and controlling background tasks without the GUI. See the [OronBox CLI and daemon documentation](docs/en/CLI.md) for usage details.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Flutter stable (we recommend managing it with [fvm](https://fvm.app); the repo root `.fvmrc` pins the version), then `flutter pub get`
- The `oronbox_network` network plugin downloads prebuilt binaries from GitHub Releases at build time, so no Rust toolchain is required
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Linux**: `gtk3` `webkit2gtk-4.1` `bluez` `libblkid` `xz`; packaging tools as needed: `dpkg-deb` (deb), `rpmbuild` (rpm), `makepkg` (arch), `linuxdeploy` or `appimagetool` (AppImage), `flatpak-builder` with the GNOME SDK (Flatpak)
  - **Android**: the Android SDK/NDK bundled with a standard Flutter setup
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++); the WebView2 SDK can be installed via `windows/scripts/install_webview2_sdk.ps1`
  - **macOS**: Xcode; can only be built on a macOS host
  - **Web**: no extra dependencies

### Build everything

```bash
tool/build_all.sh [--dev]
```

Builds Android + Web + the desktop platform of the current host. Artifacts land in `build/release/` along with a generated `sha256sums.txt`.

### Per-platform builds

```bash
# Android
tool/build_android.sh [--format apk|appbundle|all] [--abi arm64-v8a|armeabi-v7a|x86_64]

# Linux
tool/build_linux.sh [--format tar.gz|deb|rpm|arch|appimage|flatpak|all] [--abi x86_64|aarch64]

# macOS (macOS hosts only)
tool/build_macos.sh

# Windows (either one)
tool\build_windows.bat [--dev]
powershell -File tool/build_windows.ps1 [-Dev] [-SkipWebView2Sdk] [-WebView2SdkVersion <version>]

# Web
tool/build_web.sh
```

- Without `--format` / `--abi`, every format / ABI is built; on Linux `--abi` defaults to the host architecture
- Android release signing is configured through environment variables: `ORONBOX_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `ORONBOX_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ORONBOX_KEY_ALIAS`, `ORONBOX_KEY_PASSWORD`; without them the debug signing config is used
- Cross-building Linux aarch64 from an x86_64 host requires `ORONBOX_LINUX_ARM64_SYSROOT` pointing to an arm64 sysroot with the gtk3/webkit2gtk development packages; cross mode only produces tar.gz / deb / rpm / arch packages

### Versioning and artifact conventions

- The version comes from the `version` field in `pubspec.yaml`
- A clean git worktree is required by default; `--dev` allows a dirty worktree and appends git metadata to the version (e.g. `1.0.0.dirty.abc1234`)
- Artifacts are named `oronbox-<version>-<platform>[-<arch>].<ext>`; symbol archives (when present) accompany the packages
